# Unix System Services Cheat Sheet

This is a repository for capturing [cheat sheet guidance](USSCheatSheet.md) for Unix System Services in IBM Z. The cheat sheet is essential for anyone who hasn't worked in z/OS UNIX System Services. This not only applies to traditional z/OS system programmers - even experienced Linux users can find some of the commands in USS anomalous. The cheat sheet provides a set of commands (with appropriate options) that most system programmers will need at some point in their use of z/OS UNIX.
